# ECGs-Classification
Site Of Origin (SOO) Classification for OTVAs

This repo contains the history of the scripts developed by Miguel Lozano (CoMMLab-ETSE-UV) for the L / V classification from the 12 leads of ECGs 
simulated by Rubén Doste (UPF-Oxford) in different locations (SOO).

Predicting the Origin of Outflow Tract Ventricular Arrhythmias Using Machine Learning Techniques Trained with Patient-Specific Electrophysiological Simulations
Doste R., Lozano M., Gomez J.F., Alcaine A., Mont L., Berruezo A., Camara O., Sebastian R. (2019)  Computing in Cardiology,  2019-September.

This work has been extended in different ways:

  - New Datasets: Simulated (Rubén + Itziar) and Real (Zheng et al., Clinic, Teknon)
  - Featured based signal: Comparison between raw and featured signal representation
  - Data Augmentation: for the featured approach
  - PCA: PCA based features (It has not been used (yet))
